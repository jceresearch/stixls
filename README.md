kanban for Excel

How to use:
a) open the spreadsheet, you should see a new Addin tab in the ribbon (once enabled the content etc). This spreadsheet is not an Addin btw, but that is how Excel names a new a tab.

b) go to that Addin  tab and select new board, it will create a demo board, fully functional.

c) play with it, the buttons left right, reload and autoarrange should be your first port of call

d) Note that each board is self contained with their data, main board, layout and templates. There is true separation between the application and the configuration... in Excel... sorcery

e) eventually, try to read the documentation.. but not to worry, there is no documentation yet.
